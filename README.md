<!-- Nice features section to highlight key things. -->
## 🌟 Features

* Easy pinning to foreground in just one click
* Automatic pinning on game startup

## 🖥️ Platforms

Currently Stick to Top only supports Windows. Linux support (X11) is planned.
Mac is unsupported, support is planned when MAS v0.13 is out with Python 3.

### 🤔 My platform is supported, but it still says Stick to Top is unavailable

Please [report an issue](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-stick-to-top/issues/new).

## 🏅 Special thanks

This submod was inspired by @GeneTechnician's [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MASFandom/comments/1hsuc2d/a_quick_tutorial_on_how_to_make_monika_stay_on)
with a guide on how to pin MAS to the foreground using AutoHotkey. I thought of
making this a submod instead.
